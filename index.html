        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Hailing from Memphis, <span class="name">the Band Camino</span> play an appealing blend of uplifting, indie rock and lush, romantic electro-pop. Behind independently released singles like the bright "2 / 14" and the soaring piano ballad "The Black and White," they became a major streaming success in the latter half of the 2010s, forging a path to their 2019 full-length debut, tryhard, on Elektra Records.</p>

        <h2>About The Band</h2>
        <p>Friends since their high school days, <span class="name">Jeffrey Jordan</span> (vocals, guitar), <span class="name">Spencer Stewart</span> (vocals, guitar), <span class="name">Graham Rowell</span> (bass), and <span class="name">Andrew Isbell</span> (drums) formed <span class="name">the Band Camino</span> in 2015 while attending the University of Memphis. Taking influence from acts like the Killers, Walk the Moon, and Colony House as well as from the culturally rich heritage of their hometown, they self-released their debut EP, My Thoughts on You, in 2016 and found significant streaming success with both the dreamy title cut and the uplifting pop single "2 / 14." A second EP, Heaven, followed in 2017, around which time Isbell left the group to be eventually replaced by <span class="name">Garrison Burgess</span>.</p>

        <p>Basing themselves out of Nashville, <span class="name">the Band Camino</span> continued their upward ascent, notching big streaming numbers with 2018 singles like "Less Than I Do" and "Know Me." After signing a major-label deal with Elektra, the band issued their full-length debut, tryhard, in 2019.</p>
